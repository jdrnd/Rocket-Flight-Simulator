### Installation
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

### Libraries used
* `pyqt5` - Qt with python bindings to build the GUI
* `pyqtgraph` - Graphing module for pyqt to render graphs
* `numpy` - Array data types for graphing (requirement of `pyqtgraph`)



### Usage
`python3 rocket_flight_simulator/main.py`

If you get a Qt error about not being able to find the Qt platform plugin xcb, run `sudo apt-get install libxkbcommon-x11-0`.
